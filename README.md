## Description

 In our second semester assignment we were to create an
 e-commerce website that had both customer-facing and admin sections for a shoe store in Bergen called "Bryggen Shoes"
 The website should be responsive on all devices, both customer and admin sections. We got a STRAPI API supplied by Noroff
 that we had to continue working on. 
 
 The website customer section consist of :
 - Home page
 - Products page
 - Products detail page
 - Cart/basket page
 
The admin section consiste of:
 - Login/Logout
 - Add/edit products
 - Product images, for adding/editing and deleting. 

## Built With


- HTML CSS and JavaScript
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

## Getting Started

### Installing

This is where you list how to get the project started. It typically just includes telling a person to clone the repo and then to install the dependencies e.g.

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NoroffFEU/portfolio-1-example.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Running

Here is where you detail how to run the app. It typically involves the commands you'd need to run to start the project e.g.

To run the app, run the following commands:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Contributing

Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project. For big projects you will usually have a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.
