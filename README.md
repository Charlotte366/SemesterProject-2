## Description

 In our second semester assignment we were to create an
 e-commerce website that had both customer-facing and admin sections for a shoe store in Bergen called "Bryggen Shoes"
 The website should be responsive on all devices, both customer and admin sections. We got a STRAPI API supplied by Noroff
 that we had to continue working on. 
 I have used various methods to retrieve and send information to Strapi Api such as GET, POST, PUT
 and DELETE. I also used the filter function on the product page, so the customers could filter on the products names. 
 
 The website customer section consist of :
 - Home page
 - Products page
 - Products detail page
 - Cart/basket page
 
The admin section consiste of:
 - Login/Logout
 - Add/edit products
 - Product images, for adding/editing and deleting.



## Built With


- HTML SASS and JavaScript
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
